Collection of SNES Station mods.

For USB users, we recommend v0.2.6c FIX Mod Pinguinoctis or v0.2.4 with updated USBD by ffgriever.
If you're a HDD user, go with v0.2.4 rev B.
And, if you're from that 0.01% that wants to burn the games into a DVD to use with FreeDVDBoot (not ESR), then use v0.2.0 HWC MOD with updated libcdvd.
