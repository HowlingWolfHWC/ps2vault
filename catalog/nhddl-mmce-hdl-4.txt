This is a beta build of NHDDL with APA HDD and MMCE support.
Beta 2 fixes regressions with memory card fallbacks and NHDDL returning when some of detected devices don't have any ISOs.
Beta 3 fixes more regressions, drops non-standalone version, adds support for new GSM modes introduced in Neutrino nightlies and switches to using Neutrino quickboot mode.
Beta 4 fixes last title for HDL mode and resolves the conflict between MMCE and MX4SIO drivers by removing MX4SIO from default modes.

Changes:

Support for MMCE devices
Support for loading Neutrino from MMCE devices
Support for loading ISOs from MMCE devices with MMCE-enabled Neutrino
Support for granular mode selection: nhddl.yaml can contain more than one mode
Use mmceman to trigger per-title memory cards on MMCE devices instead of writing to history file
Full support for APA HDD with HD Loader partitions
Support for new GSM modes
All backends except HDL now use Neutrino quickboot for faster ISO boots
Dropped non-standalone version to reduce maintenance burden
Removed MX4SIO from default modes. MX4SIO users need to specify mode: mx4sio in nhddl.yaml for MX4SIO to be initialized.
Note that MX4SIO will disable MMCE support even if mode: mmce is set.
MMCE users are strongly recommended to place Neutrino directly on MMCE microSD into /neutrino/ instead of using PS2 memory cards for this build.

Make sure to use Neutrino 1.6.0
