A PS2 exFAT BDM launcher for neutrino.

NHDDL is a memory card-based launcher that scans FAT-formatted BDM devices for ISO files, lists them and boots selected ISO via neutrino.

It displays visual Game ID to trigger per-game settings on the Pixel FX line of products and writes to memory card history file before launching the title, triggering per-title memory cards on SD2PSX and MemCard PRO 2.

Make sure to use Neutrino 1.7.0
