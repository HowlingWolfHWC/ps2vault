PS2 Powertool that will format All Connected Memory Cards.

Multi-tap Supported! (Supports up to 8 memory cards on up to 2 multi-taps)

Note: This app does not require you to have a multi-tap. It will work fine without a multi-tap it will just disregard slots 1-3 (ports B, C and D) when a multi-tap is not connected.

By the way, this app had many names on it's many releases, so I'm dropping all of them here so you can find it using the search function:
Mass Format utility, PS2 Memory Card Formatter, Mass MC Formatter, MFU and mcFormatter.
